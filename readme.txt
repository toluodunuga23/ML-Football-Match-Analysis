In this analysis, I explore how  much does posession, xg, and goals factor into a team winning and losing a game. 

According to 2020 study,conducted by 625 Champions leagues matches 49.2% of teams won their drew 22.0%, and lost 28.7% of the matches overall, exceeding the winning rates of their rivals. 
 
 This effect was even greater when the gap of ball possession percentage between two teams in a match was higher. (https://scielo.pt/pdf/mot/v16n4/2182-2972-mot-16-04-0319.pdf)
