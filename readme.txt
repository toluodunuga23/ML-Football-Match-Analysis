In this analysis, I explore how  much does posession, xg, and goals factor into a team winning and losing a game. 

According to 2020 study, that analyzed  625 Champions leagues matches 49.2% of teams won their drew 22.0%, and lost 28.7% of the matches overall, exceeding the winning rates of their rivals. 
 
 This effect was even greater when the gap of ball possession percentage between two teams in a match was higher. (https://scielo.pt/pdf/mot/v16n4/2182-2972-mot-16-04-0319.pdf)


THe main goals of this analysis is to see if there is a way to find common themes and patterns between wins, losses and draws. 


In this EDA, Teams that had Greater than 75% posession won the game 66% of the time. One thing to notice as well is that the teams that achieved are considered part of the "Big 6". The Big 6 is composed 
of Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham, Arsenal, and Liverpool.
